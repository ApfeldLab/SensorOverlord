First, import a local file with your spectra. For example:

```R
deGFP1 <- data.table::fread("/home/julian/2019_Sensor_Overlord_Local/Spectra_and_info/Sensors_Main/pH_Sensors/deGFP1/Hanson2002/deGFP1.csv")
```

Then, extract the columns with the wavelengths and expression values of Rdeprot/Rprot, Rox/Rred, etc.

In the following methods, "values_min"/other references to 'min' refer to the ligand-bound state (e.g. reduced or protenated) and the "values_max"/other references to 'max' refer to the ligand-unbound state (e.g. oxidized or deprotenated). This is just an artifact of depreciated terminology.

```R
lambda_max <- deGFP1$V1
values_max <- deGFP1$V2
lambda_min <- deGFP1$V3
values_max <- deGFP1$V4
```

Now, you can use the `sensorOverlord::formatSpectraData` function to format the data into
a list for submission to the database:

```R
submission <- formatSpectraData(name = "deGFP1", type = "pH", readout = "emission ratiometric", lambda_max = lambda_max, values_max = values_max, lambda_min = lambda_min, values_min = values_min, sensor_midpoint = 8.02)
```

Then, when you're ready to submit your entry, you can use `sensorOverlord::getDb()` and `$insert` to add your new submission:

```R
getDb()$insert(submission)
```

## Removing entry

If you made a mistake in your entry, you may want to remove it. Assuming that your sensor name is unique:

```R
getDb()$remove('{"sensor_name" : "deGFP1"}')
```

In the future, it would be better if this database had unique IDs, in case you accidentally added
a sensor with the same name as an existing one. I can do that--it just takes a little bit of effort. If you're reading this
and using SensorOverlord, please shoot me an email (julianst [at] mit [dot] edu) and I can spend some time to make this 
db more rigorous.
