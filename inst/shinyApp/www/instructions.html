<p> To predict whether a sensor is well-suited to your needs, you need to know a few things:
</p>
<h4>How precise are your microscopy techniques?</h4>
<p>
Your microscope and analysis methods will produce noise in your ratiometric measurements.
To determine that noise, run through your microscopy pipeline with GFP or another mock sensor, making
measurements that should be consistent with each image (for example, 410/410 with a roGFP, or 410/470 with GFP).
</p>
<p>
Then, use those measurements to estimate your relative error. For example, if you find that 95% of your 410/410 measurements are between 1.02 and 0.98, your relative error is +/- 2.0%.
</p>
<h4>How accurate do you need your measurements to be?</h4>
<p>
For example, you may be trying to distinguish between
a pH of 7.1 and 7.3, in which case you will need an accuracy of at least 0.2.
</p>
<h4>What are the biochemical and biophysical parameters of your sensor?</h4>
<p>
You can generally find estimates of these parameters in the literature. We have
also aggregated these estimates in the supplementary notes of <a href = "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.928895v1">the associated manuscript.</a>
