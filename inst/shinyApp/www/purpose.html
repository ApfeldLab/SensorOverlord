<p>When you want to make <b>absolute, quantitative measurements</b> with
a <b>ratiometric biosensor</b>, we often find it difficult to choose
a sensor well-suited for our experimental designs. Or, if
we have already choosen a sensor, we usually want to know
whether it is <b>accurate enough for our experiments.</b>
</p>
<p><b>For example</b>,
it's generally accepted that roGFP1 is a good sensor to measure
redox potential in C. elegans cytosol, but that roGFP1-iE might be
a better choice for the ER.</p>
<p>This tool serves to <b>quantify that
intuition</b> and help you make <b>better-informed choices</b> for your experiments.</p>
<h4>Scope</h4>
This tool is appropriate for any ratiometric sensor with two states. It will be useful
if you convert a ratiometric measurement into a real biochemical value, such as the concentration
of a ligand or a redox potential.
<p>This tool puts all sensors into three categories:</p>
<li><b>Redox: </b>Sensors can be oxidized or reduced, and their ratio is converted to a voltage</li>
<li><b>pH: </b>Sensors can be protenated or deprotenated, and their ratio is converted to pH</li>
<li><b>Ligand: </b>Sensors can be bound or unbound, and their ratio can be converted to pLigand (the log10 of ligand concentration)</li>
